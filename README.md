# COVID-19 Tableau Visualization

I have created a dashboard with 6 visualizations to analyze and understand effects of Covid-19 in United States and Globally. 

### [Visualization Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/sampath.gonnuru#!/vizhome/Covid-19_15891658031180/Covid-19dashboard?publish=yes)

The primary goal of my visualization are to analyze: 

- How each country has been effected by Corona virus? 
- Cases and deaths over time is there a decline or not ?
- Reason behind why a curve might be flattening or not?
- Has certain Countries Lock down measures yield any benefits?
 

**Visualization 1**: *Corona virus Globally*

An eagles eye view of the map we can see that the cluster with highest number of cases are in the Northern hemisphere - united States and European countries. I first thought the cause could be due do the density of population, however there are other countries with similar density populations which speak otherwise. Therefore, I have concluded the reason for this rapid spread of virus could be two-fold

- Highest Tourism rate
- With the most number of International flight traffic
 

**Visualization 2**: *United States State Wise Details*

The visualization tells us that New York is the state which has been hit the most with covid-19. This could be due to a high density of population and tourists from all over the globe annually. With JFK airport being one of the busiest airports in the world. Also, immediate and lack of stringent measures also could have lead to the widespread cases of covid-19.

 

**Visualization 3:** *Confirmed Cases and death Count by country*

We can see that cases increased exponentially in mid march. US and Europe being among the top Countries to be the most effected with around 3 million confirmed cases and 251k deaths. Whereas countries which have been able to take drastic measures were able to curb COVID-19

 

**Visualization 4:** *Number of Cases Increased from yesterday*

This visualization proves to effective to study the trend of corona virus more closely as we can analyze what methods might be proving to be effective to put Covid-19 in check. Closely monitoring the graph with cases increase or decline of cases from yesterday can help the government and health officials to go ahead with which action to go ahead with. 

 

**Visualization 5:** *Cases and deaths over time (USA)*

We can observe that difference rate in cumulative cases show flattening. Which could possibly pertain to a decrease in spread of virus. This could be plausable due to the Lockdown measure which have been taken in the month of March. 

 
**Conclusion**

The primary reason why COVID-19 has become a global pandemic is due to the rate at which symptoms started to surface which was after a period of 14 days or 28 days in some. Within this time frame an average human per day interacts with over 2,000 vivid entities which again could be interacted with another human.

Additionally, an immediate anti-crisis measures not being put into action has also helped in the spread of virus as we can see that those countries which were able to impose restrictions were able to flatten or at least slow the curves progression.  

Finally,Countries with dense population and higher tourism rates were the ones to be highly effeted
